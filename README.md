Classification
This module is to introduce and discuss frequently used classification techniques.

Branch
Make sure you know your branch of this module.
We continue to improve the modules based on your feedbacks and submitted outputs. Therefore, we create a branch for you when we assign the module.
Go through the README.md of your branch.

Instructions
Follow the steps given below.

Step 1
Study the following algorithms.

K-nearest neighbour classification
Linear discriminant analysis
Naïve Bayes classifier
Support vector machine
Logistic regression
Random forests
Ada boost
Gradient boost
XGBoost
At the end of the excercise, you should be able to answer the following questions.

What are the important parameters in each algorithm?
How and why those parameters affect the results of respective algorithms?
Step 2
Follow the steps given below to write your code.

In your code, download a dataset using Python openml package
Prepare data
Identify the data types: boolean/categorical, ordinal, numeric in this case. But there can be many other types as well.
Transform categorical variable to numeric as necessary
Min-max normalise
Use GridSearchCV to walk through the parameter grid.
Use f1_score to assess the performance
Use random states 1 to 10
Use 5 fold cross validation in parameter search
Record execution time
Save the results to CSV files.
Step 3
Execute your code over all the algorithms and all the datasets.
Save your results to CSV files.
Step 4
Create Tableau Dashboards or Plotly visualisations to analyse your results.
With visualisations:
for each dataset compare and contrast results produced by each algorithm under optimal parameter settings
for each given algorithm, how f1_score varies with the different parameter values
Discuss the execution times of algorithms and their parameter settings?
What are the most important parameters in each algorithm
Create a presentation or a pdf document or a Jupyter Notebook explaining Naïve Bayes classifier.
Quality Standard of Your Work
Code should follow PEP8 Standard
Host your code on your GitHub in a public or private repository as you prefer.
If it is a public repository, send the link for us to evaluate.

If it is a private repository, share (view only) with our GitHub usernames. Please contact us for them.

Send us a notification to start the evaluation. We evaluate your code for your technical progress.
